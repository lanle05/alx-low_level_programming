### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

***General***
* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables

### Tasks

[0-reset_to_98.c](./0-reset_to_98.c)
```
Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
```
* Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);

[1-swap.c](./1-swap.c)
```
Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
```
* Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);
