![IMG_2410](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85158665/208409150-4f6faf86-59ba-49fe-b0a4-3f220c0db1a9.jpg)

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

***General***
* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables

### Tasks

[0-reset_to_98.c](./0-reset_to_98.c)
```
Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
```
* Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);

[1-swap.c](./1-swap.c)
```
Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
```
* Prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);

[2-strlen.c](./2-strlen.c)
```
Write a function that returns the length of a string.
```
* Prototype: int _strlen(char *s);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strlen. Run man strlen to learn more.

[3-puts.c](./3-puts.c)
```
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
```
* Prototype: void _puts(char *str);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.

[4-print_rev.c](./4-print_rev.c)
```
Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
```
* Prototype: void print_rev(char *s);

[5-rev_string.c](./5-rev_string.c)
```
Write a function that reverses a string.
```
* Prototype: void rev_string(char *s);

[6-puts2.c](./6-puts2.c)
```
Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
```
* Prototype: void puts2(char *str);
