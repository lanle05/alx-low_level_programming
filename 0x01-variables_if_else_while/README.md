**What you should learn from this project**

	At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
* What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
* What the the relational operators and how to use them
* What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
* What are the boolean operators and how to use them
* How to use the if, if ... else statements
* How to use comments
* How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
* How to affect values to variables
* How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
* How to use the while loop
* How to use variables with the while loop
* How to print variables using printf
* What is the ASCII character set
* What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64

### Exercises
[0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c)
```
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is
executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored
in the variable n is positive or negative.
```
	You can find the source code here.
* The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this
  program
* You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not
  touch this code
* The output of the program should be:
* The number, followed by
      if the number is greater than 0: is positive
      if the number is 0: is zero
      if the number is less than 0: is negative
      followed by a new line

[1-last_digit.c](./1-last_digit.c)
```
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is
executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the
number stored in the variable n.
```
	You can find the source code here
* The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
* You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
* The output of the program should be:
* The string Last digit of, followed by
      n, followed by
      the string is, followed by
      if n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
      if n is 0: the string and is 0
      if n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
      followed by a new line

[2-print_alphabet.c](./2-print_alphabet.c)
```
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
```
* You can only use the putchar function (every other function
  printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
* All your code should be in the main function
* You can only use putchar twice in your code

[3-print_alphabets.c](./3-print_alphabets.c)
```
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase,
followed by a new line.
```
* You can only use the putchar function (every other function
  (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
* All your code should be in the main function
* You can only use putchar three times in your code

[4-print_alphabt.c](4-print_alphabt.c)
```
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
```
* Print all the letters except q and e
* You can only use the putchar function (every other function
  (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
* All your code should be in the main function
* You can only use putchar twice in your code
